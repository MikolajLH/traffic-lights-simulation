# Limitations and possible improvements
## Lack of automatic computation of compatibility graph
Traffic compatibility graph is the core concept in mathematical model used for the simulation.
However, the program is not able to generate this kind of graph for an arbitrary crossroad configuration,
which partialy invalidates flexibility and scalability of the code base.


## Lack of automatic calculaction of maximal cliques
As described in the Algorithm section, at the given moment of the simulation,
traffic is only allocated to lanes that formes a clique in the compatiblity graph.  
However these cliques are not generated by the program itself, but have to be put in the code.  
This makes the usage of the application rigid and limited,
since only a selected predefined junctions design are avaialbe for performing the simualtion.  
This point is directly connected with the lack of automatic creation of the compatibility graph.
